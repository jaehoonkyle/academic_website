**Green Moral Hazard: Estimating the Financial and Non-financial Impacts of CEO Incentives**

I structurally estimate the financial and the non-financial implications of the actions induced by executive compensation contracts involving non-financial incentives. I find that such contracts incentivize CEOs to make tangible financial sacrifices to improve non-financial performance: approximately 1.3% of firm value for carbon emission intensity reduction of 1.8% per year. I then examine the extent of moral hazard and the value of information associated with the non-financial incentives. Through counterfactual analyses, I find that the cost of incentivizing improvement in non-financial performance on top of financial performance, i.e., ``green moral hazard", is substantial: $1.72 million, out of the total moral hazard cost of $2.05 million, could be attributed to green moral hazard.
