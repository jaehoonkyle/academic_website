**Green Moral Hazard: Estimating the Financial and Non-financial Impacts of CEO Incentives**

I develop a novel structural model for analyzing the financial and non-financial implications of CEO compensation contracts that include incentives tied to non-financial performance. By applying this model to green incentives, I find that they motivate CEOs to reduce carbon emission intensity by 1.8% per year but at a financial cost of 1.3% of firm value annually. As green performance is an imperfect signal of CEOs' actions toward green outcomes, a "green moral hazard‚Äù arises: the principal should offer CEOs a premium for the risk added by green incentives. I estimate that this green moral hazard is substantial, accounting for $1.72 million of the total moral hazard cost of $2.05 million. These results suggest that green incentives pose an important economic trade-off: while green incentives can lead to meaningful environmental improvements, they impose substantial costs on the firm.
