**Green Moral Hazard: Estimating the Financial and the Green Impacts of ESG Incentives**  
Dissertation Committee: Ivan Marinovic (Chair), Maureen McNichols, and Kevin Smith  

I structurally estimate the financial and environmental implications of the actions induced by executive compensation contracts involving ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) incentives. I find that such contracts incentivize CEOs to make tangible financial sacrifices to improve ESG performance: approximately 1% of firm value for carbon emission intensity reduction of 1.23% per year. I then examine the extent of moral hazard and the value of information associated with the ESG incentives. Through counterfactual analyses, I find that the cost of incentivizing improvement in ESG performance on top of maximizing financial performance, i.e., "green moral hazard", is substantial: $1.41 million, out of the total moral hazard cost of $1.67 million, could be attributed to green moral hazard.
