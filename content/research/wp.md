[**Moral Hazard and the Value of Information: A Structural Approach**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4291189)  
(with Jeremy Bertomeu and Ivan Marinovic)  
**R&R at <i><u>Journal of Accounting Research (JAR)</u></i>**  
Executive compensation contracts use information from markets and accounting to elicit efficient incentives. We structurally estimate the contribution of each performance measure to quantify the relative importance of stock price versus accounting signals. For plausible risk-aversion levels, the average cost of moral hazard, defined as the risk premium paid to elicit effort, is about $ 3.5 million. In counterfactuals, we show that in the absence of reliable accounting performance measures, average compensation increases by approximately 16%, and by more than a factor of three when price information is unavailable (e.g., for a non-public firm). At high risk-aversion levels, relying only on accounting variables can make it suboptimal or infeasible to elicit high effort, imposing potentially large losses on shareholders. These results provide a first quantitative assessment of the value of accounting signals in executive contracts.

**Learning or Catering? Effect of Managerial Myopia on Disclosure and Investment Feedback**  
Financial markets can have real effects through managers learning from prices or catering to investors to boost prices. I study how the two incentives shape a myopic manager's disclosure and investment decisions, in a “feedback effects” model with investors who can acquire private information and a manager who learns from prices when making an investment decision. I provide a novel mechanism through which disclosures can incentivize information acquisition, even though the disclosed signal and the investor's private signal are substitutes. Moreover, I show that myopic managers disclose high signals, even if doing so reduces information in price. On the contrary, value-maximizing managers resort to discretionary disclosure only when their information quality is low and the investment opportunity is risky.

[**Economics of Property Insurance**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5804802)  
(with Hyeyoon Jung)  
We study the economics of homeowners' property insurance by examining how contract design balances the trade-off between incentive alignment and risk sharing. Using granular contract-level property insurance data merged with property-level disaster risk for millions of U.S. households, we develop and structurally estimate a model in which insurers optimally determine contract terms given property risk and household risk preferences. The estimates provide, to our knowledge, the first large-scale contract-level structural measures of risk aversion, risk premia, and the cost of moral hazard, allowing us to quantify how disaster risk is allocated between insurers and households. We find that the cost of moral hazard is small, yet the very mechanism used to mitigate it substantially increases households' exposure to disaster risk: contract design leaves policyholders exposed to roughly 29 percent of total expected losses. This residual exposure is most pronounced for low-FICO households and for properties with the greatest tail risk. Counterfactuals indicate that mandating full insurance would lead to substantial market exit, increasing household vulnerability. We further show that insurers' financial constraints are systematically correlated with the riskiness of underwritten properties and with household characteristics.

**Deviations from the Law of One Price across Economies**  
(with Hyeyoon Jung)  
In a model with agents facing constraints heterogeneous across economies, we provide a novel explanation for an understudied yet economically significant deviation from the Law of One Price across FX forward markets. Specifically, we document a substantial divergence between the exchange rate for locally traded forward contracts and contracts with the same maturity traded outside the jurisdiction of countries during the global financial crisis, and that the magnitudes varied across currencies. The model predicts that (1) the basis increases with the shadow costs of constraints across time and increases with the country-specific FX position limit across countries;  (2) the shadow cost of each constraint non-linearly increases as the intermediary sector's relative performance declines below a threshold; and (3) higher shadow cost of the position limit predicts lower future excess return on local-currency denominated assets, as buying local assets relaxes the FX position limit constraint imposed on the intermediaries. We test the model predictions and find consistent evidence in the countries with tight position limits.
